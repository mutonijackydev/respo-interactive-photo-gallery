A responsive and interactive photo gallery built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating hover interactions and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.


Interactive Photo Gallery & Coding Challenges

Welcome to the Interactive Photo Gallery repository! Here you'll find an interactive photo gallery along with solutions to two coding challenges. Below, you'll find setup instructions and explanations of the approach taken for each part of the repository.

Interactive Photo Gallery
Setup Instructions:
1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.	Navigate to the interactive-photo-gallery directory.
3.	Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the interactive photo gallery.


Features:
•	The photo gallery displays a collection of images with descriptions.
•	Hovering over an image applies a grayscale effect and displays a "Read More" link.
•	Clicking on the "Read More" link reveals additional information about the image.

Approach
Interactive Photo Gallery:
•	The gallery is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	CSS transitions and effects are applied to enhance the user experience.
•	JavaScript is used to handle interactivity, such as image hover effects and dynamic content display #responsiveness.


Coding Challenges

Challenge 2: Array Map
•	File Name: arrayMap.js
•	Description: The arrayMap.js file contains a JavaScript function that determines if there exists a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to a target.
•	Setup Instructions: Execute the file using a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js) to test the function with different inputs.


Challenge 3: String Transformation
•	File Name: stringTransform.js
•	Description: The stringTransform.js file contains a JavaScript function that transforms a string based on specific rules.
•	Setup Instructions: Execute the file using a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js) to test the function with different inputs.

Coding Challenges:
•	Each challenge is approached with a focus on efficiency and readability.
•	Solutions are implemented using JavaScript and  to the given constraints.
•	Variable naming and code organization aim for clarity and maintainability.
